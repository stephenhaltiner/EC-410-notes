# Tidyverse

[Table of contents]


## Prologue

### What is tidy data?

* Each variable forms a column.
* Each observation forms a row.
* Each type of observational unit forms a table.

Basically, tidy data is more likely to be [long/"narrow" format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) than wide format.

## Tidyverse basics

### Tidyverse vs. base R

Tidyverse is great because:

* The documentation and community support are outstanding.
* Having a consistent philosophy and syntax makes it easy to learn.
* It provides a convenient front-end to some key big-data tools.
* For data cleaning, wrangling, and plotting, it is a no-brainer.
  + (The **data.table** package is also pretty great, though.)

But, a combination of tidyverse and base R is often the best solution to a problem.

There is often a direct correspondence between a tidyverse command and its base R equivalent. These generally follow a `tidyverse::snake_case` vs `base::period.case` rule.
